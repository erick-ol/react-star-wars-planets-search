## Star Wars Planet Search

This was a project developed in the [Software Development Course at Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/formacao-desenvolvimento-web) as a challenge while I was learning how to use React Context API and Hooks. In this project I was able to catch products from [Star Wars API](https://swapi-trybe.herokuapp.com/api/planets/) so users could search the planets of Star Wars Universe. Made on ```October 2nd, 2021```.

### How to download and run the project code

First of all you need to download the project files, you can do this using git.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:erick-ol/react-star-wars-planets-search.git
```

After you clone the repository you need to enter the folder that contains the project you just downloaded and install all the dependencies of this application.

```bash
npm install
```

Then you just need to start your application to have fun and learn a lot more.

```bash
npm start
```
